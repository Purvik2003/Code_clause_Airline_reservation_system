**Airline Reservation System Project**

The Airline Reservation System Project in Java was created in Java Programming Language using NetBeans IDE and MySQL Database as the System’s Back-end.
The main goal of the Airline Ticket Reservation System Project in Java is to provide an online ticketing and seat reservation system for domestic and international flights, as well as information regarding aircraft departures.

**Abstract:**

The goal of this project on Airline Management System is to automate the airline registration procedure. The system includes information such as passenger information, flight information, and a list of all passengers, as well as the ability to store and retrieve data linked to the airline business and conduct air travel transactions.
When a passenger reserves a ticket, the technology also allows us to add records.
MySQL Database is used to store and retrieve data. It allows us to add as many records as we want to our database. The “Carrier Management System” project includes a large number of flights belonging to a single airline.

**Problem Definition:****

This project on Flight Management System is the automation of registration process of airline system. The system is able to provide much information like passenger’s details, flight details and the booking details.
The system allows us to add records when a passenger reserves a ticket. It also allows to delete and update the records based on passenger’s requirements. For data storage and retrival we use the MySQL database. It enables us to add any number of records in our database from the frontend which is Java core. Any changes made in the frontend will be reflected at the backend.
